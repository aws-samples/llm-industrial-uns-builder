    "# Set-up Siemens PLCs and TIA Portal to export process and metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚õ≥ Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal for this Jupyter Notebook are to understand and achieve the following:\n",
    "1. Access a TIA Portal project data using TIA Openness API\n",
    "2. Create an import of PLC Code Datablocks (DBs)\n",
    "3. Additionally, you will also import other project metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "The exported data will form the basis of the configuration of your AWS IoT SiteWise assets and Shopfloor connectivity (SFC) framework later in this workshop\n",
    "\n",
    "### üóùÔ∏è Key Concepts and refreshers\n",
    "1. **Siemens TIA Portal**: The [Totally Integrated Automation (TIA) Portal](https://new.siemens.com/global/en/products/automation/industry-software/automation-software/tia-portal.html) is an engineering framework by Siemens that integrates automation and digitalization for designing, configuring, and commissioning automation systems.     \n",
    "2. **TIA Openness API**: The [TIA Openness API](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/document/109759162/tia-portal-openess-interface-description) is an interface provided by Siemens that allows for programmatic control and automation of TIA Portal projects, enabling custom tool integration and automated engineering workflows.  \n",
    "3. **Siemens PLCSim Advanced**: [Siemens PLCSim Advanced](https://new.siemens.com/global/en/products/automation/systems/industrial/plcsim-advanced.html) is a software tool that simulates Siemens PLCs, enabling virtual commissioning, testing, and troubleshooting of automation programs without physical hardware.  \n",
